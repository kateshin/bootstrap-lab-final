  <h3> Keith Ape and Wrongful Cultural Appropriation</h3>
  <h4> April 20, 2016 </h4>
    <p> Last year, Korean rap finally broke onto the American scene. On January 1, 2015, a Korean rap artist named Keith Ape released a music track called “It G Ma.”  It featured two other Korean artists, JayAllday and Okasian, and two Japanese artists, Loota and Kohh. The song spread through the channels of Tumblr, Reddit, and Instagram, accumulating 10 million Youtube views within a few months upon release. The artists of the song, who form the Cohort, became the first Asian group to sell out the iconic world music venue, S.O.B.’s night club in New York City in April of 2015.</p>
    <p> “It G Ma” marks an important step for Asian Americans in the world of hip-hop, especially in terms of representation in media, but it also marks an important moment in contemporary culture. Korean rap has existed for decades, but it was only recently that the English-speaking American demographic took notice through “It G Ma,” and that change has come about largely because of the influence of the Internet. “It G Ma” demonstrates that the notions of identity and community are changing for young people and Internet users today. </p>
    <p>Hip-hop is heard and created in countries all over the world today, though the genre is a form of Afrodiasporic expression rooted in the US, starting from the 1970s. “It G Ma” attracted much of its popularity through controversy over cultural appropriation. In February of 2015, OG Maco, a black trap artist from Atlanta, Georgia, accused Keith Ape of copying his music and culturally appropriating his culture. It would be difficult for Keith Ape to deny that he copied OG Maco’s music since he used very similar minimal music production of extended bass lines and kick drums. (We can also look to Keith Ape’s Youtube channel to see he covers other hip-hop songs with less artistic license than he did with “It G Ma,”ripping their audio file and ad libbing over original lyrics.) The debate then lies in OG Maco’s claim of cultural appropriation. </p>
    <p>Defined broadly, cultural appropriation is the use of elements of one culture by those who belong to a different culture. It becomes a problem when members of a dominant group exploit the culture of a less privileged group, and it usually done with no understanding of the latter group’s experiences or history. In order to address the question of cultural appropriation in Keith Ape’s music, we must first consider what legitimizes music as hip-hop. When we consider some of the defining aesthetic and stylistic characteristics of hip-hop, “It G Ma” loses some of the bite of OG Maco’s accusations of “mocking” his aesthetic by using exaggerated racial stereotypes.</p>
    <p>Hip-hop was created in the social and political atmosphere of 1970s New York. Black and hispanic communities in the city were put under major stress by postindustrial conditions. Tricia Rose, a Professor of American Studies at the University of California at Santa Cruz, recounts in her book, Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America, that “shrinking federal funds and affordable housing, shifts in the occupational structure away from blue-collar manufacturing and toward corporate and information service . . . [meant that] the city’s poorest residents paid the highest price for deindustrialization and economic restructuring” (30). Rose explains that Robert Moses, a powerful city planner of the mid 1900s, executed multiple public work projects that restructured New York and forced many of its citizens to relocate, especially black people and Puerto Ricans. It is these times of instability and job loss that brewed the conditions for hip-hop because “the youngest generation of “South Bronx exiles were building creative and aggressive outlets for expression and identification” (33). Young black and latino people gathered in their neighborhoods to pass time and play music at block parties. They experimented with tapes and records, mixing samples of music. This gave rise to the MC, the individual at an event that facilitated transitions between musicians by hyping up the crowd. Then, they, or MCs in particular, started to ad lib lines over the music, and thus rap was born. These young people spoke of partying and young relationships, but they also discussed the other important issues on their mind in their music: the struggle of making a livelihood, dealing with racial oppression, and other deep-seeded problems of New York. Hip-hop became a black, socio-political movement.</p>
    <p>At first glance, it seems Keith Ape’s “It G Ma” holds little content that reflects hip-hop’s history. In his music video, he runs around a hotel in Asia with his crew of friends, sporting the clothing of hip-hop culture. His grimy, Internet aesthetic is modelled off OG Maco’s “U Guessed It,” where OG Maco runs around a hotel in Atlanta with his own crew of friends. Keith Ape taps into a particular genre of hip-hop called trap, which refers to the place where drug deals are made. The genre, marked by aggressive lyrical content and sound, is unique to Southern America and concerns the hustle and lifestyle of people stuck in the trap. According to an article by the New Yorker, called “Getting Rowdy: Keith Ape and Real Rap in Korea,” Keith Ape is from Budang, South Korea, and he dropped out of high school at the age of 17 to pursue a career in hip-hop. His father is a music professor and his mother is a painter. Keith Ape cannot claim the trap lifestyle of Atlanta for himself, so his use of the trap sound is, undeniably, a piece that culturally appropriates. However, if you take a closer look at the images of the two music videos, Keith Ape does execute many of the major themes in hip-hop, which are also circulated in OG Maco’s “U Guessed It.” For example, the visual focus of the songs are the rappers, and a governing theme in hip-hop music is self-naming and the formation of authority. Another big motif is mastery of setting, or the hood. Both OG Maco and Keith Ape use a hotel as their set for the music video, which suggests a lifestyle of travel and a command of any public space. And like OG Maco, and many other rappers, Keith Ape alludes to rap’s traditional images of the commodity system: clothing and money. </p>
    <p>Keith Ape draws on hip-hop by playing on visual distortions to emphasize movement, and hip-hop is a musical genre about the flow and breaks to sound and movement.  Tricia Rose calls attention to music scholar, Arthur Jafa, in her discussion of movement in hip-hop: “As Arthur Jafa has pointed out, stylistic continuities between breaking, graffiti style, rapping, and musical construction seem to center around three concepts: flow, layering, and ruptures in line. In hip-hop, visual, physical, musical, and lyrical lines are set in motion, broken abruptly with sharp angular breaks, yet they sustain motion and energy through fluidity and flow.” (38). In “It G Ma,” Keith Ape plays with breaks in sounds and images by using flashes of light, symbols, and scenes of rowdy rap performances. He stylizes these images too, making them Asian. For example, he incorporates Asian money symbols into his song, such as the yen and the won, as OG Maco flashed the Benjamin Franklin hundred-dollar bill in his music video. Tricia Rose goes on to connect this stylistic trend to the circumstances that originally inspired hip hop: “These effects at the level of style and aesthetics suggest affirmative ways in which profound social dislocation and rupture can be managed and perhaps contested in the cultural area” (39). In other words, hip hop is created as a reaction or a reflection of a young person’s feelings of alienation from or frustration with their environment. It visualizes a particular lifestyle. While Keith Ape cannot claim the frustrations of socially repressed minorities in New York in the 1970s, his song is a reaction to his life in Korea. In the New Yorker article, Keith Ape confesses that “It G Ma” was his way of pushing back against the wildly theatrical, and what he considers insincere, k-pop music, which dominates Korean culture. In his interview, he also mentions that “[he obviously] didn’t grow up in that American social structure, around people slinging drugs or things like that . . . [“It G Ma” is] not necessarily a rap about struggle, but it’s definitely using the method of a turn-up to appeal to people who are antisocial, people not accepted in what’s considered mainstream, people who feel alone and disconnected.” Partying and disenfranchisement marked the young minorities of early hip hop too. Keith Ape saw rap music from across the world through the Internet and gravitated towards it for reasons similar to the black and Puerto Ricans in 1970s New York.</p>
    <p>In addition, while Keith Ape took elements of hip hop without permission, his “borrowing” of Afrodiasporic hip hop cultural traditions should not be considered exploitative, because it did not rob the other minority group of the credit they deserve. “It G Ma” does not pretend to have been created in a vacuum. Keith Ape failed to explicitly credit OG Maco as his source of inspiration, but his use of similar trap production and video production are so obvious that he could not have been avoiding comparisons of his song to OG Maco’s. In the world of hip hop, where musicians constantly borrow samples and images from each other, imitation can indeed be more flattery than it is a violation of intellectual property. Another important element of his interaction with black culture is that Keith Ape is also a member of a minority. Koreans, or Asians in general, have so little space in the realm of American hip-hop that Keith Ape’s injection into the scene does not disadvantage the recognition or economic profit of black musicians. His song merely encouraged greater appreciation for Asian rap by the American audience. In July of 2015, Keith Ape released a remix of “It G Ma” featuring African-American rappers ASAP Ferg, Waka Flocka Flame, and Father. His song’s popularity also brought greater attention to OG Maco, who went on to tour East Asia last year and collaborate with artists in Korea, such as Korea’s superstar, CL. Instead of creating one-sided profit for Asian rappers, “It G Ma” opened the gates between East and West and facilitated greater interaction between the Asian and black communities in the US. </p>
    <p>Old hip-hop head DJs used to carry around a bag of records that thye had narrowed down after years of listening to albums and sifting through material. They were limited to the physical stacks of records they could carry. They had a larger library of vinyl at home, but their understanding of each album was grounded in physical records. DJs today use a different sort of system. They use laptops to spin their music, so their archives of music can fill the infinite room of their iTunes. DJs today might know the same amount of music as the DJs of old, or they can know a lot more, but this shift in DJing maintains a trend in the spread of hip-hop in time and also among cultures: the internet has changed the parameters of hip-hop. Keith Ape accessed the images and sound of a niche hip-hop form through the Internet. He familiarized himself to a culture that originated across the world, and he imitated it, injecting it with cultural symbols that were relevant to him. He maintained the spirit of hip-hop through stylistic choices that are true to the principles of the art. While “It G Ma” may no longer be a relevant song in the ever-churning world of hip-hop, the study of this song as a piece of cultural appropriation is not without value. It shows that the parameters of what it means to interact with or enter a different culture has changed with the accessibility of the Internet. “It G Ma” is more than an act of wrongful cultural appropriation. Through engaging other significant themes of hip-hop, “It G Ma” legitimizes itself as a contemporary emblem of not only hip-hop but also of interracial relationships among young people and Internet culture. </p>
